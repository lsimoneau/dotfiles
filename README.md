dotfiles
========

My dev setup (mostly vim, with some tmux and zsh). The vim setup was originally based on [pda](https://github.com/pda)'s.

Uses [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to manage symlinks.

Usage
-----

```
gem install homesick
homesick clone lsimoneau/dotfiles
homesick symlink lsimoneau/dotfiles
```
